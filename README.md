# OOP-GameShow-App

A browser-based, word guessing game that uses JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
The .wrong class provides a red color onto the on-screen keys of incorrect guesses from the user.
The .lose class provides a red background color to the screen when the player loses the game.
